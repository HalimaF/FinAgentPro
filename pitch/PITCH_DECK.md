# Slide 1: The Problem

## Manual Financial Processes Are Killing Productivity

### Pain Points Small & Medium Businesses Face Daily:

📝 **Data Entry Hell**
- Finance teams spend 15+ hours/week manually entering receipts
- 30% error rate in manual expense categorization
- Invoice creation takes 20-30 minutes per document

💸 **Fraud Blindspots**
- $50K+ average loss per year from undetected fraud
- Traditional rule-based systems miss 40% of sophisticated attacks
- Detection happens weeks after the damage is done

📉 **Cashflow Uncertainty**
- 82% of SMBs fail due to poor cash management
- Manual forecasts based on gut feel and spreadsheets
- No visibility into future cash position

🤖 **Generic AI Limitations**
- Generic ChatGPT trained on general knowledge, not finance
- Text-only tools miss 30% of data in visual layouts
- Reactive alerts come AFTER problems occur

⏰ **Time Drain**
- CFOs spend 60% of time on operational tasks vs strategic work
- Approval workflows bottleneck across multiple stakeholders
- End-of-month close takes 5-7 days

### The Real Cost: $75K-$150K per year in wasted resources
